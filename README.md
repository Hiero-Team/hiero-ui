## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the `HieroCheckoutButton` component in your React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { HieroCheckoutButton } from '@hiero/ui';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <HieroCheckoutButton 
        appName="your-app-name"
        redirectUrl="https://your-app.com/success"
        email="user@example.com" // Optional
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `HieroCheckoutButton` component accepts the following props:

- `appName` (required): The name of your application registered with Hiero.
- `redirectUrl` (required): The URL to redirect to after successful checkout.
- `email` (optional): Pre-fill the user's email if known.

When clicked, the button will redirect the user to the Hiero checkout page with the provided parameters.
